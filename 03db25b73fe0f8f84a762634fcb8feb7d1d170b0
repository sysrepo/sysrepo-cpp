      "message": "Do we actually need this class? I think that upstream prefers using libyang\u0027s structs, and the \"old-style\" sysrepo values are there just for compatibility (at least that\u0027s the way I remember the story). Since we don\u0027t care about source compatibility here at all, I think it would be nice to skip the sr_val_* bits completely, and focus on the native libyang structs only.\n\nThat said, I think it\u0027s actually very convenient to be able to \"just pass things around as strings\". And that also looks like a good start, providing something like:\n setValue(const std::string_view xpath, std::string_view value);\n std::string getItem(const std::string_view xpath) const;",
