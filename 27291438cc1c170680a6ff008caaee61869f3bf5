But please do *not* ever \"insert\" extra arguments like this; IMHO it\u0027s much, much better to introduce them \"in a sequence\". It looks like there won\u0027t be much extra work in rebasing this, so please introduce these commits in the \"proper\" order.",

      "message": "Sure, done. But can you send me some reading on why is that a problem? Because *do not ever do that* seems like a very strong statement (would the world burn?) that is followed by a \"IMHO\" statement.\n\nI think there might be obvious problems when two consecutive arguments have a same type (or implicitly convertible types) while converting the codebase.\nBut I don\u0027t see what else could go wrong.",
