In this context I\u0027m afraid a little bit that all the projects which perform that annoying two-phase data purge and whose unit tests are written with that assumption, I\u0027m worried a bit that porting will need a bit more time. Let me check. (And we have -Werror in the CI anyway, so a deprecated attribute will still require some effort.)",
