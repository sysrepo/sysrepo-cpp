      "message": "The .zip file is a \"resulting artifact\" of a build job, other build jobs will in future unpack these artifacts and store them \"somewhere\". If you configure this build job to create a zip file with the \"html/\" prefix, that means that either the consumers will have to strip this prefix, or have the \"html/\" part visible in user-facing URLs, or configure a webserver which will be serving these artifacts with a \"html/\" subdir. There\u0027s an existing convention in upstream Zuul jobs that the documentation is put directly under \"docs/\". I\u0027m not saying that this is unsolvable, but I\u0027d prefer to leave this as-is unless you have a strong reason for this change.",
