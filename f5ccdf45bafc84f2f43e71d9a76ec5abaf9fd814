      "message": "I had to re-read this test a few times. When exactly are notifications processed (i.e., when is that time that \"something\" retrieves a dynamic notification from sysrepo and passes that to the trompeloeil handlers which were set up by `REQUIRE_NAMED_NOTIFICATION`)? If it only happens at the time `READ_NOTIFICATION*` is called, don\u0027t you need to poll for these notifications after lines 380 and 385 as well?\n\nDon\u0027t you need to \"poll if there\u0027s any unexpected notification\" after this loop has run? Hmm, probably not, because there\u0027s a `REQUIRE_PIPE_HANGUP` at the very end, and (I guess) any pending notifications would cause that check to fail with an error \"yup, it\u0027s hang up, but there were also pending notifications\" or something like that...\n\nFinally, I think that instead of having a vector of notifications (which, to me, implies that it\u0027s a *sequence* of notification events, that you\u0027ll always generate them all and in-order, etc), it would make sense to have three \"totally independent\" notifications with names, e.g., `pingWith42`, `pingWith666` and `silentPing`. Just a suggestion for a future refactor.",
